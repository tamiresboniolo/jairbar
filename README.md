# Jair's Bar Website

This website is a project to my dad's bar in Brazil. It gave me the chance to apply my knowledge in HTML/CSS at first when I started to code.
The design of the website was completely up to me. So, I chose black and gold as principal colors. I still need to work on some parts of it and imporve my code as my knowledge grows.
However, the project provided me experience in the creative and artistic aspects of designing and implementing an effective website.
