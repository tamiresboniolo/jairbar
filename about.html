				<h3>Good Food, Good Drinks, and Good Company.</h3>
				Jair's bar is a proud establishment in the historic and ever-changing neighborhood of Pioneer Square.
				 We are Located in Historic Pioneer Square 650 First Ave. S, in the beautifully renovated Pacific Commercial Building.
				 Originally built in 1800, the building and space have undergone many transformations.
				</p>
				<p>We opened Jair's Bar to build a new gathering place for good food, good drink and good company that feels like it has
				 always been there. Keeping with the traditions and aesthetics of this one-of-a-kind area, Jair's Bar is a neighborhood 
				 bar for a different kind of neighborhood.
				</p>
				<p>Jair's Bar is the concept Jair Boniolo and his wife, Rosana, have been imagining and working toward for years. 
				The idea is simpleâ€¦a really good bar with classic cocktails, an extensive beer list, a thoughtful wine program 
				and friendly, detailed service. Our food is straightforward and delicious, always made from quality ingredients.
